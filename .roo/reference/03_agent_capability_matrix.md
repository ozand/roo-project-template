- **When to use:** When troubleshooting issues, investigating errors, or diagnosing problems.

#### ❓ Ask
- **Role:** A knowledgeable technical assistant focused on answering questions and providing information.
- **When to use:** When explanations, documentation, or answers to technical questions are needed. Does not make changes to the code.

#### 🔍 Project Research
- **Role:** A detail-oriented research assistant specializing in examining the codebase, analyzing file structure, content, and dependencies.
- **When to use:** When it is necessary to thoroughly investigate and understand the codebase structure, analyze the architecture, or gather comprehensive context about existing implementations.

#### 📝 User Story Creator
- **Role:** An agile requirements specialist focused on creating clear and valuable user stories.
- **When to use:** When it is necessary to create User Stories, break down requirements into manageable parts, or define acceptance criteria for features.

#### ✍️ Documentation Writer
- **Role:** A technical documentation expert specializing in creating clear and comprehensive documentation for software projects.
- **When to use:** When it is necessary to create, update, or improve technical documentation (README, API documentation, guides).
