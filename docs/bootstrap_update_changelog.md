# Bootstrap Script Update Mode Changelog

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the `--update` mode functionality in the `bootstrap.py` script, which enables safe synchronization of local projects with the latest template files while preserving user modifications.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Safe File Synchronization
- **SHA256 Hashing System**: Uses SHA256 hashing to detect changes in existing files and prevent overwriting user modifications
- **Template Hash Persistence**: Maintains a record of original template file hashes in `.roo/.template_hashes.json`
- **Selective Updates**: Only updates files that haven't been modified by the user

### 2. Backup and Recovery
- **Automatic Backups**: Creates backup copies of files with `.backup` extension before overwriting
- **Safe Copying Logic**: Implements a robust file copying mechanism that preserves user changes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases during file operations

### 3. User Experience
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Provides detailed statistics on added, updated, and skipped files
- **Clear Status Indicators**: Uses intuitive emojis (‚úÖ, üîÑ, ‚è≠Ô∏è, ‚ùå) to indicate operation status
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows detailed progress information during the update process

### 4. Symbolic Link Management
- **Automatic Link Creation**: Creates symbolic links from `.roo/rules/` and `.roo/commands/` to `pages/` directory
- **Link Updates**: Refreshes symbolic links during update operations
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Handles symbolic link creation on different operating systems

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Hashing System
- **Hash Calculation**: Uses SHA256 algorithm to calculate file hashes
- **Hash Storage**: Stores hashes in JSON format in `.roo/.template_hashes.json`
- **Hash Comparison**: Compares current file hashes with stored hashes to detect modifications
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles hash calculation errors without stopping the update process

### Update Process Flow
1. **Template Cloning**: Clones the latest template from the specified repository
2. **Directory Processing**: Processes each template directory (`.roo`, `scripts`, `pages`, `docs`, `journals`)
3. **File Analysis**: Analyzes each file in the template directories
4. **Modification Detection**: Checks if existing files have been modified by the user
5. **Safe Operations**: 
   - Adds new files that don't exist in the project
   - Updates existing files only if they haven't been modified
   - Skips files that have user modifications
   - Creates backups before overwriting any files
6. **Symbolic Link Management**: Updates symbolic links in the `pages/` directory
7. **Statistics Reporting**: Provides detailed statistics about the update operation

### PowerShell Compatibility
- **Cross-platform Commands**: Uses cross-platform compatible commands for initialization
- **Windows Support**: Specifically tested and verified to work on Windows systems with PowerShell

## Safety Mechanisms

### User Modification Protection
- **Hash-based Detection**: Uses file hashing to accurately detect user modifications
- **Skip Mechanism**: Automatically skips files that have been modified by the user
- **Notification System**: Clearly notifies users about skipped files

### Backup System
- **Pre-update Backups**: Creates backup copies before any file modification
- **Backup Management**: Automatically removes backup files after successful operations
- **Recovery Options**: Allows users to manually recover from backup files if needed

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation even if some files fail to process
- **Detailed Error Reporting**: Provides specific error messages for troubleshooting
- **Rollback Capability**: Maintains system state consistency even in error conditions

## Command Line Interface

### Primary Commands
```bash
# Standard update
python bootstrap.py --update

# Update with custom repository
python bootstrap.py --update --repo https://github.com/user/custom-template.git
```

### Additional Modes
```bash
# Initialize new project
python bootstrap.py --init

# Migrate existing project
python bootstrap.py --migrate
```

## Usage Statistics

The update mode provides comprehensive statistics at the end of each operation:
- **Added files**: New files that were added to the project
- **Updated files**: Existing files that were updated (unmodified files)
- **Skipped files**: Files that were not updated because they were modified by the user
- **Errors**: Any errors that occurred during the update process

## Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Regular Updates**: Run the update mode periodically to keep projects synchronized with template improvements
2. **Review Skipped Files**: Manually review skipped files to merge important template changes
3. **Backup Projects**: Maintain project backups before running updates
4. **Check Reports**: Review update statistics to understand what changes were made

### For Developers
1. **Template Structure**: Maintain consistent template directory structure
2. **Hash Management**: Ensure proper hash file management for accurate modification detection
3. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Test on multiple platforms to ensure compatibility
4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling for all operations

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Manual Merge Required**: Files with user modifications must be manually updated to incorporate template changes
2. **Directory Structure Dependent**: Only works with the standard RooCode template directory structure
3. **Hash-based Detection**: Relies on file hashing which may not detect all types of modifications in complex scenarios
4. **Symbolic Link Permissions**: May require elevated permissions on Windows to create symbolic links
