# Learning Documentation

This page serves as the central documentation for learning concepts and lesson tracking within the project's knowledge base. Learning documentation captures insights, experiences, and lessons learned throughout the project lifecycle.

## Purpose and Scope

Learning documentation helps teams:

- **Capture institutional knowledge** from project experiences
- **Identify patterns** in successes and failures  
- **Improve future planning** based on historical insights
- **Share knowledge** across team members and phases
- **Track continuous improvement** efforts

## Learning Categories

Learning outcomes are categorized into three main types:

### Technical Learning
Technical learnings related to:
- Architecture decisions and their outcomes
- Technology choices and trade-offs
- Implementation approaches and their effectiveness
- Performance optimizations and bottlenecks
- Code quality and maintainability insights

### Process Learning
Process learnings covering:
- Development methodology effectiveness
- Team collaboration patterns
- Communication strategies
- Workflow optimizations
- Project management approaches

### Communication
Communication learnings including:
- Stakeholder engagement strategies
- Documentation effectiveness
- Knowledge sharing mechanisms
- Cross-team coordination
- Requirements gathering techniques

## Learning Properties

Each learning documentation entry should include:

- **Type**: `[[learning]]`
- **Phase**: Link to the relevant project phase
- **Impact**: `positive` or `negative`
- **Category**: `technical`, `process`, or `communication`
- **Related Stories**: Links to relevant user stories
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the lesson learned
- **Recommendations**: Actionable insights for future work

## Creating Learning Documentation

Learning documents should be created:

1. **At phase completion** - Capture lessons from each project phase
2. **After major milestones** - Document insights from significant achievements
3. **Following incidents** - Record lessons from challenges or failures
4. **During retrospectives** - Formalize team discussions into documented insights

## Usage in Project Management

Learning documentation integrates with:

- **Project Hub dashboards** - Display learning trends and insights
- **Phase planning** - Inform future phase planning with historical data
- **Team onboarding** - Provide context for new team members
- **Process improvement** - Identify areas for optimization
